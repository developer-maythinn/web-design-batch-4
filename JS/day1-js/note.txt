Javascript is the most popular scripting language or programming language
JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
JavaScript files have the file extension .js


********************************************
JavaScript Where To
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
  <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">   
           document.write("Hello World!")
console.log('Hello")

External JavaScript
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.

You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

***************************************************
Why use External JavaScript
As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.

The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.

Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.

That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World";
</script> 

***************************************************
Comments
One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //
Multiline comments /* */

Variables
var is an old-school variable declaration
let is a modern variable declaration.
const is like let, but the value of the variable canâ€™t be changed.

the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:
let message = 'Hello!';

Declare multiple variables in one line:
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';

We can also change it as many times as we want
let message;
message = 'Hello!';
message = 'World!'; // value changed
alert(message);

We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other
let hello = 'Hello world!';
let message;
// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;

// now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello); // Hello world!
alert(message); // Hello world!
