A variable should be declared only once.
A repeated declaration of the same variable is an error
let message = "This";
// repeated 'let' leads to an error
let message = "That";  // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared

“var” has no block scope
if (true) {
  var test = true; // use "var" instead of "let"
}
alert(test); // true, the variable lives after if

if (true) {
  let test = true; // use "let"
}
alert(test); // Error: test is not defined

Variable naming
The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit.
JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and name are two different variables.
Variables named apple and AppLE are two different variables.

Reserved names
There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.

For example: let, class, return, and function are reserved.

The code below gives a syntax error:

let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!
let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!

An assignment without use strict
Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using let. This still works now if we don’t put use strict in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.

num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist
alert(num); // 5
This is a bad practice and would cause an error in strict mode:

"use strict";
num = 5; // error: num is not defined

Constants
Means that a variable’s value never changes
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error

Uppercase constants
 Constants are named using capital letters and underscores. constants can be declared with uppercase or lowercase.
example: 
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
 easier to remember
 easier to mistype
much more meaningful 
capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.

Some good-to-follow rules are:
Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart.
Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, c, unless you really know what you’re doing.
Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are data and value.
If a site visitor is called a “user” then we should name related variables currentUser or newUser instead of currentVisitor or newManInTown.

**********************************************************

Data types
There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.
Number
String
Boolean (logical type)
The “null” value
The “undefined” value
The typeof operator
Objects and Symbols
BigInt

Number
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;
special numeric values: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
example: alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous
alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_infinity.asp#:~:text=Infinity%20is%20a%20numeric%20value,which%20is%201.797693134862315E%2B308.

String
let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`; Template literals or string template

In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
Double quotes: "Hello".
Single quotes: 'Hello'.
Backticks: `Hello`.


Boolean (logical type)
The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
let isGreater = 4 > 1;
alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")

The “null” value
It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

The “undefined” value
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”(empty value).

Type of operator
typeof 0              // Returns "number"
typeof 314            // Returns "number"
typeof 3.14           // Returns "number"
typeof (3)            // Returns "number"
typeof (3 + 4)        // Returns "number"
typeof 10n // "bigint"
typeof null // "object" 

Difference Between Undefined and Null
undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:

typeof undefined           // undefined
typeof null                // object

null === undefined         // false
null == undefined          // true

Array
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

Objects
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person.age
